**Instructions for TA/Buddy:**
1. Deploy this template to your Azure subcription by clicking this button 
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmadhura0110%2FPilotWeek%2Fmain%2FApp1%2Ftemplate.json
)

2. Once deployed, access the App and notice that you receive an HTTP 403. The engineer is supposed to work with you or research on their own to figure out why the app is throwing an HTTP 403.

3. Create a support case from the Azure portal under the above App Service's **Help + Support** Blade: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest.
Copy-paste the following in the case description:

      _Case title: Web App is down_

      _Issue Description: My Web App is down. It was working fine when I logged off work last night but today nothing works._

4. Grab the case number, open case on DFM and manually assign this case to the engineer.

**Aim of this exercise:**
1. Help the engineer get acquaitned with using DFM to meet SLA, log quality notes, add labor, access ASC etc.

2. Get the engineer into the habit of asking clarifying questions like:
    What do you mean by Web App is down?
    What is the error messgae you see on your browser?
    Are there other users facing the same issue with the same App?
    Can you access other Apps without any issues?
    When was the last time this app was working as expected?
